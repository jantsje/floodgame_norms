# floodgame_norms
This application allows to use the Floodgame as an oTree application in three languages (English, Spanish and Dutch) with several treatments. The experiment was conducted in October 2019 among 605 Spanish homeowners. By uncommenting several lines in the code, you can run the game in Dutch and/or run different treatments.
